# LucienBot

Discord bot developed in python that demonstrates a simple addition command that 
can add two numbers or concatenate two strings together, whether they are provided as digits or strings. 
This showcases how the bot can perform basic calculations. The bot uses the discord.ext.commands framework 
to handle user-defined commands easily!
